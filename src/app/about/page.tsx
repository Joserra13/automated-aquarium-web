              The Automated Aquarium project transforms a traditional aquarium
              into a smart IoT device, allowing users to monitor and control
              various aspects remotely.
              <br className="extra-space" />
              Key features include: <br className="extra-space" />
              Live Streaming: Broadcast real-time footage of your aquarium on platforms like
              Twitch.<br/>
              Sensor Integration: Monitor environmental parameters such
              as temperature, pH levels, and water quality through integrated
              sensors.<br/>
              Remote Management: Adjust settings and control devices
              like feeders and lights from any location. 
              <br className="extra-space" />
              The project encompasses a range of technologies, from web development to embedded systems,
              and is continually evolving. A companion website, built with
              Next.js, showcases the project&rsquo;s capabilities and provides
              comprehensive documentation to assist users in setting up and
              maintaining their automated aquariums.
