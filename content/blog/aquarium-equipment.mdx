- [Water treatment for stabilization](#water-treatment-for-stabilization).

- [Natural water plants](#natural-water-plants).
- [Decorations](#decorations).
- [pH test](#ph-test).
- [Wallpaper](#wallpaper).

### Water filter

Undoubtedly, one of the accessories you must consider is the aquarium filter, as it is essential. This device keeps the water circulating, filtering out all kinds of bacteria and dirt present in the aquarium.

Fish produce all sorts of waste (food leftovers, feces, etc.), which can be harmful to their health over time. A filter helps balance the ecosystem, ensuring that the fish enjoy a suitable and healthy environment.

In my case, I decided to start with
